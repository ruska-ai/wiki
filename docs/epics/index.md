# Epics

Epics let you organize and track larger initiatives by grouping related tasks together. Use them to plan features, track progress, and keep your work structured.

## Overview

-   **Task Organization**: Group related tasks under a single epic
-   **Status Tracking**: Track task progress with To Do, In Progress, Done, and Blocked states
-   **Progress Summary**: See at a glance how many tasks are complete
-   **Search & Filter**: Quickly find epics by name or description

### Task Statuses

Each task has a status dropdown with four options:

-   **Done** — task is complete
-   **Blocked** — task is waiting on a dependency or issue

Click the status dropdown on any task to change its status. The epic's progress summary updates automatically.
