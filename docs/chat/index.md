# Chat

The chat page is Orchestra's main interface for interacting with AI assistants. It features a rich input area with tool controls, file management, model selection, voice dictation, and image support.

## Chat Input Controls

The input bar is organized into a textarea for your message and a row of control buttons below it.

### Left-Side Controls

**Tools Menu (+)** — manage tools available for the current conversation:
-   **Image Upload**: Attach photos to your message
-   **Web Search Toggle**: Enable or disable web search (shown as a quick toggle)
-   **Configure Tools**: Opens the full tool selection modal to add platform tools, API tools, MCP servers, and A2A agents
-   A badge on the button shows the count of active tools

**File Manager (folder icon)** — toggle between chat view and the file editor:
-   Click to switch to the **Editor** view where you can create and manage files (including [AGENTS.md](../assistants/agents-md.md))
-   A badge shows the number of files currently loaded
-   On desktop, the editor appears as a resizable side panel; on mobile, it opens as an overlay

**Agent Menu (bot icon)** — select an assistant for the conversation:
-   Opens a searchable list of your assistants
-   Click an assistant to apply its configuration (instructions, model, tools)
-   Click **Clear selection** to return to the default agent
-   When an assistant is selected, its name appears as a badge next to the button

**Project Badge** — shown when chatting within a [project](../projects/index.md) context:
-   Displays the project name with a folder icon
-   Click the **X** to remove the project association

### Right-Side Controls

**Model Badge** — shows the current AI model with the provider icon:
-   Displays the model name (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5") with the provider logo (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
-   Click to navigate to **Settings** where you can change your default model
-   The model can also be set per-assistant in the [assistant configuration](../assistants/index.md#model-selection)

**Submit / Record Button** — a circular button that changes based on context:
-   **Microphone icon**: When the input is empty — click to start voice recording
-   **Square icon**: When recording — click to stop
-   **Up arrow icon**: When there's text or images — click to send the message
-   **Stop icon** (red): When a response is streaming — click to abort

## Voice Dictation

Orchestra supports voice-to-text input for composing messages by speaking.

**How to use:**
1. With an empty input, click the **microphone button** or press **Alt + H**
2. A voice visualizer bar appears above the textarea showing the recording is active
3. Speak your message
4. Click the **stop button** or press **Alt + H** again to stop recording
5. Your speech is transcribed and inserted into the textarea
6. Edit the transcription if needed, then submit

:::info
Voice dictation is only available when the input field is empty (no text or images). Clear the input first to start recording.

## Image Support

You can attach images to your messages for multi-modal conversations.

**Paste from clipboard:**
-   Copy an image and press **Ctrl/Cmd + V** in the chat input
-   The image appears in a preview grid above the textarea

**Drag and drop:**
-   Drag image files from your file manager onto the chat input
-   Multiple images can be dropped at once

**Via Tools Menu:**
-   Click the **+** button and use the image upload option

**Limits:**
-   Maximum **10 images** per message
-   Maximum **5 MB** per image
-   Supported formats: common image types (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, etc.)

Images appear in a preview grid with thumbnails. Click an image to see a full-size preview, or click the **X** to remove it.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## Message Queue

When a response is streaming and you want to send another message, Orchestra queues it for you:

1. While a response is streaming, type your next message and press **Enter** (or click submit)
2. The message appears in a **queue panel** above the input showing the queued count
3. Queued messages execute in order after the current response finishes
4. You can **edit** or **remove** queued messages before they're sent
