# Getting Started with Orchestra

Welcome to Orchestra! This guide walks you through the complete onboarding process — from creating an account to configuring your AI assistant with persistent memories.

## What You'll Learn

-   How to create an account or sign in
-   Navigating the Orchestra interface
-   Configuring your default AI model in Settings
-   Creating your first memory
-   Adding AGENTS.md as a memory for consistent agent behavior

## Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser
-   An Orchestra instance (e.g., [chat.ruska.ai](https://chat.ruska.ai))

## Step 1: Create an Account or Sign In

Navigate to your Orchestra instance. You'll see the landing page with a chat input and two options at the bottom:

-   **Get Started Free** — create a new account
-   **Sign in** — log into an existing account

![Landing Page](/img/getting-started/01-landing-page.png)

Click **Get Started Free** to register, or **Sign in** if you already have an account.

### Sign In

On the login page, enter your credentials:

-   **Email**: Your registered email address
-   **Password**: Your password

You can also sign in using **GitHub** or other configured OAuth providers.

![Login Page](/img/getting-started/02-login-page.png)

Click **Sign in** to continue. You'll be redirected to the main chat interface.

## Step 2: Explore the Interface

After signing in, you'll land on the main chat page. Here's what you'll see:

![Chat Interface](/img/getting-started/03-chat-interface.png)

### Sidebar (Left)

-   **Assistants** — browse and select pre-configured AI agents
-   **Memories** — manage persistent context that the AI remembers across conversations
-   **Projects** — organize document indexes for knowledge bases
-   **Schedules** — set up scheduled agent tasks
-   **Threads** — view and resume previous conversations

### Main Chat Area (Center)

-   **Text Input** — type your message or question here
-   **Tools Button** (the number badge) — view and manage available tools
-   **Manage Files** — attach files to the current conversation
-   **Assistant Selector** — pick a pre-configured assistant (or use the default)
-   **Model Indicator** — shows the current AI model (click to go to Settings)

### Top Bar

-   **Toggle Sidebar** — collapse or expand the sidebar
-   **Share Thread** — share the current conversation
-   **Theme Toggle** — switch between Day, Dusk, and Night themes

### User Menu (Bottom-Left)

Your username and email are shown at the bottom of the sidebar. Click the **gear icon** next to it to open Settings.

## Step 3: Configure Your Default Model

Click the **model name** next to the chat input (e.g., "gpt-5.2") or the **gear icon** in the bottom-left to open the **Settings** page.

![Settings Page](/img/getting-started/04-settings-page.png)

The Settings page includes:

-   **Default Model** — choose which AI model is used for new conversations. Use the dropdown to select from available models across providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, xAI, AWS Bedrock).
-   **Default Sandbox** — choose the code execution backend for agent tasks. "Auto (Recommended)" tries Daytona first, then falls back to local.
-   **AI Provider Keys** — add your own API keys to use your credentials instead of the system default.

:::tip Model Recommendations
-   **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — balanced performance for complex reasoning
-   **Claude Haiku 4.5** — fast and cost-effective for simple tasks
-   **GPT-5.2** — excellent all-around performance
-   **Gemini** — strong multi-modal capabilities
:::

## Step 4: Create Your First Memory

Memories are persistent context snippets that Orchestra automatically injects into every conversation. Navigate to the **Memories** page by clicking **Memories** in the sidebar.

![Memories Page](/img/getting-started/05-memories-page.png)

Click **Add Memory** and enter context you want the AI to always know. For example:

> I prefer Python for backend development and TypeScript for frontend. My timezone is America/Chicago.

Click **Save**. The memory is now stored and will be applied to all future conversations.

:::info Why Memories Matter
Without memories, you'd need to repeat your preferences in every new conversation. With memories, the AI already knows your context before you type a single message.
:::

For a detailed walkthrough of creating, editing, and deleting memories, see the [Memory Tutorial](./memories/tutorial.md).

## Step 5: Add AGENTS.md as a Memory

The most powerful use of memories is storing an `AGENTS.md` file — a markdown document that defines how your AI agent should behave. When stored as a memory, these instructions are automatically applied to **every conversation**.

1. Go to the **Memories** page
2. Click **Add Memory**
3. Paste your AGENTS.md content. For example:

```markdown
# My Project Agent

You are a senior engineer working on our project.

## Rules
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Always write tests for new code
- Use type hints for all functions

## Persona
You are concise, pragmatic, and focused on shipping quality code.
```

4. Click **Save**

The AI will now follow these instructions in every conversation — no need to attach the file manually each time.

:::tip File Attachment vs Memory
Attaching an `AGENTS.md` file to a thread only applies to that single conversation. Storing it as a memory applies it everywhere. Use memories for your default instructions, and file attachment when you need thread-specific overrides.
:::

For more details on the AGENTS.md format and how it works, see [AGENTS.md](./agents-md/index.md). For a step-by-step guide on storing it as a memory, see [Memory Tutorial — Step 6](./memories/tutorial.md#step-6-store-agentsmd-as-a-memory).

## Step 6: Send Your First Message

Navigate back to the chat page by clicking the **Orchestra** logo in the top-left corner. Type a message in the text input and press **Enter**:

**Example first messages:**

-   `What is Orchestra and what can it do?`
-   `Help me write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers`
-   `What's the latest news about AI development?` (requires search tool)

The AI will respond using your selected model, and if you created memories, it will already know your preferences.
