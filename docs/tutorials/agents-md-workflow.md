This guide walks you through the AGENTS.md workflow — creating, editing, and managing file-based instructions for your Orchestra assistants. For API usage and advanced topics, see the full [AGENTS.md reference](../assistants/agents-md.md).

## Overview

AGENTS.md replaces the old Instructions and System Prompt form fields with a file-based approach. Instead of typing instructions into form inputs, you create an `AGENTS.md` file in the assistant's file panel. This gives you:

- **Version-controllable** instructions you can manage in Git
- **Composable** configuration using standard Markdown
- **Consistent** patterns across tools (mirroring Claude Code's `CLAUDE.md`)

## Step 1: Create a New Assistant

Navigate to **Assistants** in the sidebar and click the **+** button to create a new assistant. You'll see the agent create form with fields for **Name**, **Description**, and **Model** — but no Instructions or System Prompt fields. Instead, a guidance note directs you to create an AGENTS.md file in the file panel.

Fill in the assistant's **Name** and **Description**, then select a **Model** from the dropdown.

## Step 2: Open the File Panel

Switch to the **Editor** view by clicking the toggle in the top-right corner. This opens the file panel with an **Explorer** sidebar on the left and an editor area on the right.

Click **Create File** to add a new file to the assistant.

## Step 3: Create and Edit AGENTS.md

In the Create New File dialog, type `AGENTS.md` as the filename and click **Create**. The file opens in the editor where you can write your instructions using Markdown.

Write your instructions using Markdown headings, lists, and sections. Here's an example structure:

```markdown
# Sales Assistant

You are a professional sales assistant for Acme Corp.

## Role
- Answer product questions accurately
- Guide customers toward the right solution
- Always be helpful, never pushy

## Rules
- Never discuss competitor products negatively
- Always offer to connect with a human agent for complex issues
```

:::tip Use Markdown Structure
Organize your AGENTS.md with headings, lists, and sections. Clear structure helps the AI model follow your instructions more reliably.
:::

## Step 4: Save the Assistant

Switch back to the **Config** view and click **Save** to create the assistant. The AGENTS.md file is stored with the assistant and its content is automatically used as instructions whenever the assistant processes a request.

## Editing an Existing AGENTS.md

To update an assistant's instructions:

1. Open the assistant and switch to the **Assistant** tab
2. Click **Manage Files** to open the file panel
3. Click on `AGENTS.md` in the Explorer sidebar
4. Edit the content in the editor
5. Switch to **Config** and click **Save**

## Migrating from Legacy Instructions

If you have an existing assistant that uses the old `instructions` or `system_prompt` fields, the Config view shows an amber **Legacy Instructions** card with your current instructions content and a **Migrate to AGENTS.md** button.

![Legacy migration card with Migrate to AGENTS.md button](/img/agents-md/04-legacy-migration-card.png)

To migrate:

1. Open the assistant and switch to the **Config** tab
2. Click **Edit** to enable editing mode
3. Click **Migrate to AGENTS.md** — this creates an `AGENTS.md` file with your existing instructions
4. Review and edit the newly created file if needed
5. Click **Save**

After migration, the AGENTS.md file takes priority. Your assistant continues to work exactly as before.

:::info Backwards Compatibility
Existing assistants with legacy instructions continue to work unchanged. Migration is optional — AGENTS.md only takes effect when the file is present.
:::

## Using AGENTS.md in Thread Mode

You can also use AGENTS.md without a dedicated assistant. In the default chat (no assistant selected):

1. Click **Manage Files** in the chat input area
2. Create an `AGENTS.md` file in the file panel
3. Write your instructions
4. The content is injected as instructions for that conversation

This is useful for one-off conversations where you want specific behavior without creating a full assistant.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it focused** — write instructions specific to the assistant's purpose
- **Use Markdown structure** — headings and lists help the model follow instructions
- **Version control** — store AGENTS.md files in Git alongside your project code
- **File name must be exact** — the file must be named exactly `AGENTS.md` (case-sensitive)
