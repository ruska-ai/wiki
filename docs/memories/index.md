# Memories

Memories are persistent, per-user context snippets that Orchestra automatically injects into every agent conversation. They allow your AI assistants to remember preferences, facts, and instructions across threads without repeating yourself.

## Overview

-   **Persistent Context**: Memories survive across threads and sessions
-   **Per-User Scoping**: Each user has their own private set of memories, namespaced by user ID
-   **Automatic Injection**: Memories are retrieved and injected as files into the agent's context at the start of every conversation
-   **AGENTS.md Integration**: Store your [AGENTS.md](/agents-md) instructions as a memory so they apply to every conversation automatically — no need to attach the file manually each time
-   **LangGraph BaseStore**: Memories are stored via LangGraph's BaseStore, providing a reliable key-value persistence layer
-   **Full CRUD API**: Create, read, update, and delete memories programmatically

## How It Works

The memories lifecycle follows this flow:

1. **Create a Memory** — A user creates a memory via the API or the Settings UI (e.g., "I prefer Python for backend development" or an entire AGENTS.md file)
2. **Stored in LangGraph BaseStore** — The memory is persisted in the LangGraph BaseStore, namespaced by user ID, with a path identifier (e.g., `AGENTS.md`)
3. **Automatic Retrieval** — When a conversation starts, `prepare_memory_files()` fetches all enabled memories for the current user
4. **Injected as Files** — Each memory is converted into a file and injected into the agent's context. For example, a memory with path `AGENTS.md` becomes a file the agent can read just as if it were attached to the thread
5. **Personalized Responses** — The agent reads the memory files and tailors its responses accordingly

This happens automatically in every entry point — streaming, worker, and invoke — so you never need to manually pass memories into conversations.

:::tip Store AGENTS.md as a Memory
The most powerful use of memories is storing your [AGENTS.md](/agents-md) instructions as a memory. This gives every conversation consistent agent behavior without manually attaching the file. See the [Memory Tutorial](./tutorial.md#step-6-store-agentsmd-as-a-memory) for a step-by-step guide.

## API Reference

All memory endpoints require authentication via a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

### List Memories

Retrieve all memories for the authenticated user with optional filtering.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/memories?limit=10&offset=0&query=' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

**Query Parameters:**

-   `limit` (int, default: 10, max: 100) - Number of memories to return
-   `offset` (int, default: 0) - Number of memories to skip
-   `query` (string, default: "") - Search filter for memory content

**Response:**

```json
{
    "memories": [
        {
            "id": "mem_abc123",
            "content": "I prefer Python for backend development and TypeScript for frontend.",
            "metadata": null,
            "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
        }
    ],
    "total": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "offset": 0
}
```

### Get a Single Memory

Retrieve a specific memory by ID.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/memories/mem_abc123' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "id": "mem_abc123",
    "content": "I prefer Python for backend development and TypeScript for frontend.",
    "metadata": null,
    "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Create a Memory

Create a new memory for the authenticated user.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/memories' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -d '{
  "content": "I prefer Python for backend development and TypeScript for frontend.",
  "metadata": {"category": "preferences"}
}'
```

**Request Body:**

-   `content` (string, required) - The memory text (min length: 1)
-   `metadata` (object, optional) - Arbitrary key-value metadata

**Response (201 Created):**

```json
{
    "id": "mem_abc123",
    "content": "I prefer Python for backend development and TypeScript for frontend.",
    "metadata": {"category": "preferences"},
    "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Update a Memory

Update an existing memory by ID.

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/memories/mem_abc123' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -d '{
  "content": "I prefer Python for backend and TypeScript for frontend. My timezone is America/Chicago.",
  "metadata": {"category": "preferences"}
}'
```

**Request Body:**

-   `content` (string, required) - The updated memory text (min length: 1)
-   `metadata` (object, optional) - Updated metadata

**Response:**

```json
{
    "id": "mem_abc123",
    "content": "I prefer Python for backend and TypeScript for frontend. My timezone is America/Chicago.",
    "metadata": {"category": "preferences"},
    "created_at": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-16T14:00:00Z"
}
```

### Delete a Memory

Delete a memory by ID.

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/memories/mem_abc123' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

**Response:** `204 No Content`

## Configuration via UI

You can also manage memories through the Orchestra web interface without writing any code. The Memories page provides a visual editor for creating, editing, searching, and deleting memories.

### Creating a Memory

Click **Add Memory** to open the creation form. Give your memory a file name (e.g., `AGENTS.md`, `preferences.md`) and write the content using the built-in markdown editor.

### Viewing and Editing a Memory

Click **Edit** on any memory card to view its full content. The detail view includes a **Preview** tab for rendered markdown and an **Editor** tab for raw editing, along with an **Enabled** toggle to control whether the memory is injected into conversations.
